This repository is a monorepo, the way it works and how the files are agenced is explained in readme.md

## Frontend and Backend

- Always use named parameters and output types `async myFunction({paramA}:{paramA:string}): Promise<string>{}`.
- Prefer functional programming when it is more legible. Avoid classes.
- Order functions, json and object variables by name; Order import with types first, then regular imports, by name too.
- When using optional parameters, prefer writing them like this: `myParam: string | undefined` because it has better DX, and avoid `myParam?: string` unless asked to.

## Backend

- Use Drizzle, do not create migrations or SQL files

## Tests

- Tests are located in a folder always next to the original file, with the `test/integration` and `test/unit` sub-folders.
- Use vitest for tests, group tests by function using describe
