- Avoid using libraries if possible
- If you are not sure a syntax exists, create a comment above it to indicate you are not sure
- Limit your response to the given instructions, if the instructions are too limited or lack context, ask the user for clarification
- Try to do things step by step, even if it requires multiple calls, so the user has time to review your code
- Name new files based on their folder, ignore the src (ex: `database/src/user/database-user.ts` or `api/src/routes/auth/api-routes-auth.py`)
- Write typescript unless specifically asked to write in another language
